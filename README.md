# Fun-Python-Projects
I am currently getting more rooted in my python skills and currently building fun on the side projects

[Organize_downloads.py](https://github.com/FaithOIgwe/Fun-Python-Projects/blob/2e0c351a5764d39e007b8fb7f404dc804cf1022d/Organize_downloads.py) project was on organizing my downloads folder. My downloads folder was a mess and I couldn't keep track of where things were. Everything was everywhere and it was hard to keep up.
